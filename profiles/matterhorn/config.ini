# This is a sample configuration file for Matterhorn. This file shows
# all available configuration options and their defaults. For any
# options that have filesystem path values (e.g. urlOpenCommand), home
# directory expansion will be done if "~" is found in the path.

[mattermost]
# Username. Optional. If missing, you'll be asked to provide one on
# startup.
user: lfschmid

# Hostname: Optional. If missing, you'll be asked to provide one on
# startup. Note that this is just the IP address or hostname of the
# server; it should not include anything else such as URL scheme, path,
# etc.
host: mattermost.uwaterloo.ca

# If the team setting is set, it must be the name of a team of which
# the user is a member. This is the team you'll automatically use when
# connecting and you'll bypass the team selection. If the setting is
# absent or isn't one of your teams, you'll be prompted for a choice of
# your teams.
#
team: esg

# Server port. Optional; defaults to 443. NOTE: If you are not using TLS
# and intend to use another port, you MUST set the port accordingly and
# then set unsafeUseUnauthenticatedConnection to disable TLS. Matterhorn
# uses TLS by default regardless of the port value.
#
# port: 443

# Server URL path. If the Mattermost server is located at
# https://example.com/mattermost then this would be set to
# /mattermost. Optional. Defaults to empty string.
#
# urlPath: /path/to/server

# Password command. Optional. If this and the password option are both
# missing or give the wrong password, you'll be prompted on startup.
#
# You can also just use
#
# pass: password
#
# but this is much less secure than supplying a command or being
# prompted interactively.
#
# For OS X, the built-in security command can be used to get a password
# from the OS X keychain. To make this work you'll need to put your
# Mattermost password into your keychain as follows:
#
# * Open the Keychain application (Applications -> Utilities -> Keychain
#   Access)
# * Click the "login" keychain.
# * If necessary, click the unlock icon at the top-left corner of the
#   window to unlock keychain access.
# * Click the "+" button at the bottom of the window.
# * Enter a keychain item name (e.g. "mattermost"), your Mattermost
#   username, and your password.
# * Click "Add".
#
# Now the keychain item name can be used with the "security" command
# here:
#
# passcmd: security find-generic-password -s <password name> -w
#
# On Linux, there are a number of options. secret-tool is part of
# libsecret (in libsecret-tools on Ubuntu) and acts as a uniform
# interface to all password managers implementing the LibSecret D-Bus
# API (including kwallet and gnome-keyring). Assuming that you have
# stored a password using
#
# $ secret-tool store --label='matterhorn' matterhorn password
#
# You can then set:
#
# passcmd: secret-tool lookup matterhorn password

# Access token token command. Optional. If this is specified, the
# provided command will be executed to obtain an OAuth or Personal
# Access Token that can be used instead of username and password
# credentials for authentication with the Mattermost server. The token
# command takes precedence over username and password configuration
# options, i.e., when a token is specified username and password options
# are ignored. Providing this setting is equivalent to entering a token
# in the login user interface's "Access Token" field.
#
# For details on how to configure your system's keychain, see the
# 'passcmd' documentation above.
#
# The token command functions just like the password command. If you
# have obtained a personal access token and stored it in your keychain,
# you can use it like this:
#
# tokencmd: secret-tool lookup matterhorn token

# This optional setting controls how the client displays times. If it's
# absent, you get the default behavior ("%R"). If it's present but
# empty, that turns timestamps off. Otherwise its value is used as the
# time format string.
#
# The format string is that accepted by 'formatTime':
# https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.6.0.1/docs/Data-Time-Format.html#v:formatTime
#
# timeFormat: %R

# This optional setting controls how the client displays dates. If it's
# absent, you get the default behavior ("%Y-%m-%d"). Otherwise its value
# is used as the time format string.
#
# The format string is that accepted by 'formatTime':
# https://hackage.haskell.org/package/time-1.6.0.1/docs/Data-Time-Format.html#v:formatTime
#
# dateFormat: %Y-%m-%d

# Whether to show timestamps on messages.
#
# Default: True
#
# showMessageTimestamps: True

# Theme name
#
# For now, the choices are
#
#   builtin:dark (default)
#   builtin:light
#
# theme: builtin:dark

# Theme customization file
#
# This setting is optional. If present, it must either be:
#
# * A relative path to a theme customization file. In this case
#   the relative path is treated as relative to the location of the
#   configuration file. For example, if the Matterhorn configuration
#   file is at $HOME/.config/matterhorn/config.ini and this setting has
#   the value "theme.ini", then Matterhorn will look for this file at
#   $HOME/.config/matterhorn/theme.ini.
# * An absolute path to a theme customization file.
#
# themeCustomizationFile: /path/to/file

# Smart character pair insertion for "``", "**", and "__".
#
# Allowed values are True and False (case sensitive). Invalid values are
# ignored. Default is True.
#
# smartbacktick = True

# Terminal bell control: ring the terminal bell whenever a new message
# arrives (for use with e.g. terminal multiplexers).
#
# Allowed values are True and False (case sensitive)
# Default is False
# activityBell = False

# Notification script control: run a notification script whenever a new
# message arrives. See the "notify" script in notification-scripts/ for
# an example Linux notification script. See docs/notification-scripts.md
# for details on the notification script API.
#
# activityNotifyCommand = /path/to/notify

# Background activity display: Matterhorn communicates with the
# Mattermost server using asynchronous background thread processing.
# This parameter can be used to enable a visual display of when and
# how much background activity is occurring. The 'ActiveCount' value
# displays the number of queued work requests to the background thread;
# there may be multiple server messages performed for each work request,
# so this value is just a relative indicator of the amount of work
# pending for processing by this thread.
#
# Allowed values are: Disabled, Active, ActiveCount
# Default is Disabled
# showBackgroundActivity = Disabled

# The command to use to open attachments and URLs found in chat
# messages.
#
# Matterhorn invokes this command with the URL as a command
# argument. Matterhorn assumes the command will perform the opening
# asynchronously, i.e., Matterhorn assumes the command will return
# immediately after invoking a background process to open the URL. This
# is how OS X's "open" command behaves and is also true for Linux's
# "xdg-open". Matterhorn will also only ever invoke this command for one
# URL at a time. If, for example, the "open all URLs" action is invoked
# on a message with more than one URL, this command will be invoked
# repeatedly, once per URL. The same is true for message attachments.
#
# If the program exits with a non-zero exit status, Matterhorn will
# treat that as a URL opener failure and will report it to you as an
# application error message.
#
# A typical value for this on OS X is:
# urlOpenCommand = open
# A typical value for this on Linux is:
# urlOpenCommand = xdg-open

# This setting indicates whether the URL-opening command is interactive
# in the terminal. Set this to True if your urlOpenCommand is a terminal
# web browser or other program that needs to control the terminal while
# viewing a URL. Set this to False otherwise.
# Default: False
#
# urlOpenCommandIsInteractive = False

# Whether to show a message rendering preview
# Default: False
#
showMessagePreview = True

# Whether to show the channel list
# Default: True
#
# showChannelList = False

# Whether to show more than the first line of the current channel's
# topic if it has multiple lines
# Default: True
#
# showExpandedChannelTopics = True

# How many days to keep a direct channel in the channel list after the
# last message.
#
# Default: 7
# directChannelExpirationDays = 14

# Whether to enable the spell checker if "aspell" is present on the
# system.
# Default: False
#
enableAspell = True

# Name a specific Aspell dictionary to use. See "aspell dicts" for a
# list of available dictionaries on your system.
# Default: fall back to environment / locale
#
# aspellDictionary = "..."

# Force Matterhorn to use HTTP instead of HTTPS. This is mostly included
# for testing purposes; you really should not use this unless you're
# absolutely sure it's what you want, i.e., you run an HTTP server and
# you are aware that doing so means you have no transport security.
#
# unsafeUseUnauthenticatedConnection = False

# Whether to validate the server's TLS certificate. It is STRONGLY
# RECOMMENDED to keep this set to its default value of True. Only
# disable this if your server certificate is self-signed or is not
# part of your keychain, and if you are okay with the risk of using an
# untrusted certificate.
#
# Default: True
#
# validateServerCertificate = True

# The width of the channel list (in columns).
#
# channelListWidth = 20

# The orientation of the channel list. Valid values are "left" (the left
# side of the screen) and "right" (the right side of the screen).
#
# Default: left
#
# channelListOrientation = left

# The maximum size of the internal log buffer, in log entries. This
# buffer is initially flushed to the log file when logging starts.
# Matterhorn keeps these log entries around, discarding old entries to
# keep the buffer from exceeding this size.
#
# logMaxBufferSize = 200

# Whether to show indicators on edited messages that have not been
# edited recently.
# Default: True
#
# showOlderEdits = True

# Whether to show the indicator for users typing and to send the typing
# notifications to the server.
# Default: False
#
# showTypingIndicator = False

# Whether to hyperlink URLs in the terminal. When enabled, this means
# Matterhorn will emit special escape sequences to make URLs clickable.
# Some terminal emulators do not support this feature, and in some of
# those cases the program's output can be garbled so this setting is
# provided for that case.
# Default: True
#
# hyperlinkURLs = True

# The list of directories from which to load Kate XML syntax definitions
# for code block syntax highlighting. The syntax is a colon-separated
# list of paths, with the highest-precedence path appearing first.
#
# Optional. If omitted, this defaults to:
#
#   USER_SYNTAX:BUNDLED_SYNTAX
#
# where USER_SYNTAX is a special path alias for
# ~/.config/matterhorn/syntax/ and BUNDLED_SYNTAX is a special path
# alias that refers to the path to XML files in the Matterhorn
# distribution relative to the 'matterhorn' binary.
#
# syntaxDirectories = /path1:/path2:/path3:...

# The CPU usage policy for Matterhorn.
#
# Valid values are "single" and "multiple". The default is "multiple".
# If set to "single", the application will be constrained to a single
# CPU. This mode can sometimes result in interface input latency. If set
# to "multiple", the application will use more than one CPU up to an
# application-defined reasonable maximum, or the number of CPUs on the
# host, whichever is smaller.
#
# cpuUsagePolicy = multiple

# The default attachment browser path. Optional.
#
# If this is specified and the directory at this path exists, the
# path will be used as the starting path of the attachment browser.
# If not specified or if the path does not exist, the current working
# directory of matterhorn process will be used as the starting path of
# the attachment browser.
#
# defaultAttachmentPath = /path/to/folder
